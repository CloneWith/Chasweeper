# Wordweeper

Puzzle game built for ENGG1330 group project. We decided to call it "*Wordweeper*", a combination of "*Word*" and "*Minesweeper*".

## How to run?

In ENGG1330 course we have to test our game on ed platform. Under this circumstances, you can run this game by following steps:

1. In ed workspaces, copy all the contents in this repository.

> *I'm sure that ed workspaces has blocked the access right to the web, at least Github. So using `git clone` is not an option.*

2. Under the root directory, run:

> `python main.py`

---

If you're not running on ed workspaces, run `python main.py` under the project root directory instead.
Make sure that your CLI or terminal supports python package `curses`.
